# Lovely Stay (js approach)

## Introduction
In this project, there is my approach to the exercise. As said, I know typescript is preferable but I currently do not have that much experience working on a typescript project. Although I don't think that's a dealbreaker as I'm highly adaptable, I think that I would thrive nontheless if I was working on a project already "done" in typecript where I could learn by watching what is done and adpating to my needs. There might exists some barriers at first while I'm getting used to it, but I think that's normal. I prefer to develop in plain javascript so I first can deliver something that's actually working. I think time is of essence right now and I was afraid not having the time to delivery something in typescript that was not working. I will, in another repo, try the typescript approach if I have the time to it.

## Setup
I recommend you stopping all containers running to prevent different containers using the same port. For that, please check your running containers with <b>docker ps</b> and then simply run as well <b>docker stop "container name"</b>.

After that, it should be all ready to install this application and make it work.
